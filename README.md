##  Short abstract of the project
CalmU, is a web app for listening to Ambience noises. It’s meant to be put in the background, although most of the work was making a pleasant UI experience. 

#### Short Note: This branch is what is hosted online, but the master branch has all the components and none of the extra vercel junk. It’s *slightly* out of date, but not by much (has no audio).
