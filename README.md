# It's a site so I dont really need a demo.  

For now vercel (my host), is screwed up because of the size of my audio files. But the URL is linked in the top right (https://calm-u.acrose99.vercel.app/)

It's been hell troubleshooting this because my internet connection has been awful and it takes 4 hours to deploy. 

If you are kind enough, cloning the project and running it locally *works way better*. 

Steps to run locally;
1. Clone the repo.
2. ```cd calmU```
3. ```npm install```
4. ```npm dev```
5. go to your localhost as prompted. 

##  Short abstract of the project
CalmU, is a web app for listening to Ambience noises. It’s meant to be put in the background, although most of the work was making a pleasant UI experience. 

#### Short Note: This branch is what is hosted online, but the master branch has all the components and none of the extra vercel junk. It’s *slightly* out of date, but not by much (has no audio).
